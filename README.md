# Monitoring CO2 Emissions of Telegram Groups with Environmental Compensation

## 1. CO2 Emissions Monitoring
- Implement a mechanism to calculate the CO2 emissions associated with the activity of Telegram groups.
- Use Telegram APIs to collect data related to group activity (e.g., messages sent, files shared, active users).

## 2. Monitoring Dashboard
- Create an interactive dashboard to display real-time CO2 emissions for each group.
- Integrate key metrics such as total emissions, emissions per user, and temporal trends.
- Provide functionality for viewing historical data.

## 3. Notification System
- Configure a notification system to send alerts when a group's emissions reach a predefined threshold.
- Support notifications via Telegram, email, or other messaging systems.

## 4. Integration with Tree Planting Programs
- Connect to a tree planting program to offset CO2 emissions.
- Automate the sending of planting orders when the emission threshold is reached.
